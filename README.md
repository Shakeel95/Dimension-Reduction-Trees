# Dimension-Reduction-Trees
 
This project investigates the use of tree-like structures to reduce the dimensionality of / discover local structure within a large pannel of heterogeneous time series. 

## Directories

The directory structure for this repository is as follows: 

```
Dimension-Reduction-Trees
    |
    |--write-ups
    |   |-- 1_name
    |   |-- 2_name
    |
    |-- data
    |   |-- 1_name_data
    |   |-- 2_name_data
    |
    |-- code 
    |   |-- 1_name_script/notebok
    |   |-- 2_name_script/notebok
    |
    |-- pipeline 
    |   |-- 1_name_script/notebok
    |   |-- 2_name_script/notebok
    |
    |-- outputs
```
The function of each sub-directory is as follows: 

* `write-ups`: LaTeX files explaining research idea as well as any implementation
* `data`: contains scripts for retrieving data from external sources, links to external sources from which data is collected manually, and the data itself
* `code`: contains all scripts and notebooks for implementing and the testing research idea
* `pipeline`: any data generated by running scripts in the `code` folder
* `outputs`: a single notebook which implements reseach idea and displays interesting findings
